# What I learn 

I was able to learning a lot from this task because I wrote all the codes based on what I've been learning and know and I am amaze I'm writing close to 100 lines of code on my own without a code along tutorial or any help from anyone. I learn more of how to createElement, appendChild, classList, delete button that remove an li from the ul section, input focus on entering the input items. Also understanding the localStroage setItem, getItem, removeItem, and clearItem.

# What I want to continue learning
I want to keep learning about localStorage because I feel like I'm still having little difficulty but I'll only get better with constant practice I know that for sure.
